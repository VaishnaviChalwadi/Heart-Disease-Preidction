# Heart-Disease-Preidction
To predict whether the person is suffering from heart disease or not.

I am thrilled to discuss my project focused on addressing the challenges associated with heart disease. Heart disease remains a leading cause of mortality globally, emphasizing the urgency to develop effective strategies for prevention and treatment. World Health Organization has  estimated 12 million deaths occur worldwide, every year due to Heart diseases. Half the deaths in the United States and other developed countries are due to cardio vascular diseases. This research intends to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk using logistic regression.
